The Office of Student Life of the university has hired you to design a mobile app to help students ease their frustrations when it is time to register for classes.

Below is a list of features that your client would like to include in the app:

<ul>

 <li>Generate up to 50 schedules that fit your classes</li>

 <li>Filters to tailor the schedule to your life such as focusing on late classes, minimizing gaps, and even input your work schedule and meeting times</li>

 <li>Port your created schedule to Google Calendar with the click of a button</li>

 <li>Follow classes and receive a notification when a spot opens up</li>

</ul>

Task 1: Create a user story for each of the feature mentioned in the list above.

Task 2: For each of the user stories from Task 1, list the following use case information:

<ul>

 <li>Name</li>

 <li>Actors</li>

 <li>Entry Condition</li>

 <li>Exit Condition</li>

 <li>Event Flow</li>

</ul>

Task 3: Create a UML use-case diagram for this app. There should be only one diagram that includes all the use cases described.
